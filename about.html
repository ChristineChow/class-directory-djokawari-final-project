              DJ Okawari is an independent Japanese DJ, record producer and composer born
              and based in Shizuoka, Japan. His style mixes instrumental hip hop, nu jazz,
              and japanese jazz. Piano is an instrumental theme in his music. In his career,
              he has released seven studio albums: “Diorma” in 2008, “Mirror” in 2009,
              “Kaleidoscope” in 2011, “Compass” in 2017, “Restore” (with Emily Styler) and

              Under the theme of “Coexistence of music and life”, DJ Okawari expresses
              the things he feels in life through sound. The tranquility that comes right
              before falling alseep, the dignified feeling when opening a book… He creates
              sounds that underscore the connection between settings and emotions. The
              name DJ Okawari comes from the Japanese word “okawari”, or “seconds”,
              because he is never satisfied with just one helping. He is always seeking
              something new to challenge.

            </p>

              Besides his work on his own albums, DJ Okawari has also participated in
              many works within Japan and outside of it. His warm and gentle Hiphop tracks
              have a worldwide appeal. The are for DJ Okawari’s album covers were created
              by Japanese graphic artist Marumiyan.
